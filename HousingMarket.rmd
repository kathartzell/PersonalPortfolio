### Home Values in Select Markets

**A. According to the results, which market has the lowest median price (represented as horizontal bar in box plot)?**
Charlotte-Concord-Gastonia appears to have the lowest median home price.
**B. The violin plot will show density meaning the wider the plot is, the more observations occur within that area. Which market has the most density around the median value of homes?**
Asheville appears to have the greatest density of homes falling at the median home price.
**C. The box plot will also show outliers in the various markets. Which metro area had the largest outlier (i.e., the highest value home sold in the past 10 years)?**
Wilmingston has the greatest outlier, followed by Asheville.

### Future Home Values 

**A. Which is the only city that is projected to have a decrease in home values in the next 3 months?**
All four cities are projected to have a decrease in home values over the next three months.
**B. If you are only concerned about the largest home value increase (by percentage) in the next 12 months, which city would you choose to relocate to?**
None of the cities are projected to have an increase in value over the next twelve months. Houston or Denver are predicted to hold their value the most, though are still projected to see a roughly 2% decreases in home value over the next twelve months.
